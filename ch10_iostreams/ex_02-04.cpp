/*
 2. Write a program that creates a file of data in the form of the temperature Reading type defined in §10.5.
    For testing, fill the file with at least 50 “temperature readings.”

3. Write a program that reads the data from raw_temps.txt created in exercise 2 into a vector
    and then calculates the mean and median temperatures in your data set.

4. Modify the program from exercise 2 to include a temperature suffix c for Celsius or f for Fahrenheit temperatures.
    Then modify the program from exercise 3 to test each temperature, 
    converting the Celsius readings to Fahrenheit before putting them into the vector.
