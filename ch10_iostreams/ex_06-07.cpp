/*
6. Define a Roman_int class for holding Roman numerals (as ints) with a << and >>.
    Provide Roman_int with an as_int() member that returns the int value,
    so that if r is a Roman_int, we can write cout << "Roman" << r << " equals " << r.as_int() << '\n';.

7. Make a version of the calculator from Chapter 7 that 
    accepts Roman numerals rather than the usual Arabic ones, for example, XXI + CIV == CXXV.
