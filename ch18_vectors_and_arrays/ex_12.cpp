12. Implement a version of the game “Hunt the Wumpus.”
    “Hunt the Wumpus” (or just “Wump”) is a simple (non-graphical) computer game originally invented by Gregory Yob. 
    The basic premise is that a rather smelly monster lives in a dark cave consisting of connected rooms. 
    Your job is to slay the wumpus using bow and arrow. In addition to the wumpus, the cave has two hazards: bottomless pits and giant bats. 
 
    If you enter a room with a bottomless pit, it’s the end of the game for you. 
    If you enter a room with a bat, the bat picks you up and drops you into another room. 
    If you enter the room with the wumpus or he enters yours, he eats you. 
    
    When you enter a room you will be told if a hazard is nearby:
        “I smell the wumpus”: It’s in an adjoining room.
        “I feel a breeze”: One of the adjoining rooms is a bottomless pit.
        “I hear a bat”: A giant bat is in an adjoining room.

    For your convenience, rooms are numbered. Every room is connected by tunnels to three other rooms. 
    When entering a room, you are told something like 
        “You are in room 12; there are tunnels to rooms 1, 13, and 4; move or shoot?”
    Possible answers are
        m13 (“Move to room 13”)
    and 
        s13–4–3 (“Shoot an arrow through rooms 13, 4, and 3”).
    
    The range of an arrow is three rooms. At the start of the game, you have five arrows.
    The snag about shooting is that it wakes up the wumpus and he moves to a room adjoining the one he was in — that could be your room.

    Probably the trickiest part of the exercise is to make the cave by selecting which rooms are connected with which other rooms.
    You’ll probably want to use a random number generator (e.g., randint() from std_lib_facilities.h) 
    to make different runs of the program use different caves and to move around the bats and the wumpus. 
    
    Hint: Be sure to have a way to produce a debug output of the state of the cave.
