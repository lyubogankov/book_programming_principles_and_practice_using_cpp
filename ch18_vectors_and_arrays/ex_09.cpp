9. Consider the memory layout in ยง17.4. 
    Write a program that tells the order in which static storage, the stack, and the free store are laid out in memory. 
    In which direction does the stack grow: upward toward higher addresses or downward toward lower addresses? 
    In an array on the free store, are elements with higher indices allocated at higher or lower addresses?
