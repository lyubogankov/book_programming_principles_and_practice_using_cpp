/*
2. Design and implement a Name_pairs class holding (name,age) pairs where name is a string and age is a double. 
   Represent that as a vector<string> (called name) and a vector<double> (called age) member.
   
   Provide an input operation read_names() that reads a series of names.
   Provide a read_ages() operation that prompts the user for an age for each name.
   Provide a print() operation that prints out the (name[i],age[i]) pairs (one per line) in the order determined by the name vector.
   Provide a sort() operation that sorts the name vector in alphabetical order and reorganizes the age vector to match.
   
   Implement all “operations” as member functions. Test the class (of course: test early and often).


3. Replace Name_pair::print() with a (global) operator << and define == and != for Name_pairs.
