/*
13. Write a Tracer class where its constructor prints a string and its destructor prints a string. 
    Give the strings as constructor arguments. 
    
    Use it to see where RAII management objects will do their job 
    (i.e., experiment with Tracers as local objects, member objects, global objects, objects allocated by new, etc.). 
    
    Then add a copy constructor and a copy assignment so that you can use Tracer objects to see when copying is done.
