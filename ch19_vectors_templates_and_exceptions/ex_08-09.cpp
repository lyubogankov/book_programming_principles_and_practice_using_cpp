8. Implement an allocator (§19.3.7) using the basic allocation functions malloc() and free() (§B.11.4). 
    Get vector as defined by the end of §19.4 to work for a few simple test cases. 
    Hint: Look up “placement new” and “explicit call of destructor” in a complete C++ reference.

9. Re-implement vector::operator=() (§19.2.5) using an allocator (§19.3.7) for memory management.
