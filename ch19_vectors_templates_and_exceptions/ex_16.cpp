/*
16. Sometimes, it is desirable that an empty vector be as small as possible. 
    For example, someone might use vector<vector<vector<int>>> a lot but have most element vectors empty. 
    
    Define a vector so that sizeof(vector<int>)==sizeof(int*), that is, so that the 
    vector itself consists only of a pointer to a representation consisting of the elements, the number of elements, and the space pointer.
