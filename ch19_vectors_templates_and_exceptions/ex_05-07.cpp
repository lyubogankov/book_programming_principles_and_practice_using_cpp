/*
5. Define a class Int having a single member of class int. 
    Define constructors, assignment, and operators +, â€“, *, / for it. 
    Test it, and improve its design as needed (e.g., define operators << and >> for convenient I/O).

6. Repeat the previous exercise, but with a class Number<T> where T can be any numeric type. 
    Try adding % to Number and see what happens when you try to use % for Number<double> and Number<int>.

7. Try your solution to exercise 2 with some Numbers.
