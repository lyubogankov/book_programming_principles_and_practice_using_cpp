/*
3. Write a function, void to_lower(char* s), 
    that replaces all uppercase characters in the C-style string s with their lowercase equivalents. 
    For example, `Hello, World!` becomes `hello, world!`.
    Do not use any standard library functions. 
    A C-style string is a zero-terminated array of characters, so if you find a char with the value 0 you are at the end.

4. Write a function, char* strdup(const char*), 
    that copies a C-style string into memory it allocates on the free store. 
    Do not use any standard library functions.

5. Write a function, char* findx(const char* s, const char* x), 
    that finds the first occurrence of the C-style string x in s.
