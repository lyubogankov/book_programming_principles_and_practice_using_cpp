/*
1. What is the output format of pointer values on your implementation? Hint: Donâ€™t read the documentation.

Based on the drill, it's in hexadecimal - 12 hex digits
    0x7ffc8bed1b84

2. How many bytes are there in an int? In a double? In a bool? Do not use sizeof except to verify your answer.

    Preliminary answers, based on looking at addresses:
        int:    4 bytes
        double: 8 bytes
        bool:   1 byte

    Using `sizeof()` operator confirms the findings above!!
