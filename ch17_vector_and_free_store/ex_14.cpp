14. Could the “list of gods” example from §17.10.1 have been written using a singly-linked list; 
    that is, could we have left the prev member out of Link? 
    Why might we want to do that? For what kind of examples would it make sense to use a singly-linked list? 
    
    Re-implement that example using only a singly-linked list.
