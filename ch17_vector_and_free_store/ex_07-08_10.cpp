/*
7. Write a program that reads characters from cin into an array that you allocate on the free store. 
    Read individual characters until an exclamation mark (!) is entered. 
    Do not use a std::string. Do not worry about memory exhaustion.

8. Do exercise 7 again, but this time read into a std::string 
    rather than to memory you put on the free store (string knows how to use the free store for you).

10. Look at your solution of exercise 7. 
    Is there any way that input could get the array to overflow; 
    that is, is there any way you could enter more characters than you allocated space for (a serious error)? 
    Does anything reasonable happen if you try to enter more characters than you allocated?
