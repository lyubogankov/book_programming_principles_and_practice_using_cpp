/*
6. This chapter does not say what happens when you run out of memory using new. Thatâ€™s called memory exhaustion.
   Find out what happens. You have two obvious alternatives: look for documentation, 
   or write a program with an infinite loop that allocates but never deallocates. Try both.
   Approximately how much memory did you manage to allocate before failing?
