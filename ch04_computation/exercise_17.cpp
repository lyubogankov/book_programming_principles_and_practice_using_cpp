/*
Write a program that finds the min, max, and mode of a sequence of strings.
*/


/*
Idea -- start with an empty vector.
For each string seen, add a vector of length 2 to the parent vector -- 1st idx = string, 2nd idx = count.

Once user is done entering strings, traverse parent vector and find min/max/mode!
